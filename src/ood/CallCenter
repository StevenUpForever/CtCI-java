Call Center: Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, and director.
An incoming telephone call must be  rst allocated to a respondent who is free.
If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager.
If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director.
Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method dispatchCall ()
which assigns a call to the first available employee.

1. Core Objects

Respondent
Manager
Director

2. Relation

3. Action & design

employee:
boolean isAvaliable
boolean takeCall()
void hangoutCall()

respondent extends employee:
int priority
enum type

manager extends employee:
int priority
enum type

director extends employee:
int priority
enum type

dispatchCall():
key point is use queue for respondent, manager and director, and assign by priority
加上set放take call的employee
维护三个queue，和一个set

当employee take call, 从list start 拿第一个，放到set
当employee hangout call，从set delete，放到queue end
当respondent queue is empty，同样步骤manager queue， director queue
