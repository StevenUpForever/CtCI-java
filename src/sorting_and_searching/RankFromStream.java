    10.10 Rank from Stream
    Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers.Periodically,you wish to be able to look up the rank of a number x
    (the number of values less than or equal to x). Implement the data structures and algorithms to support these
    operations. That is, implement the method track (int x), which is called when each number is generated, and the
    method getRankOfNumber(int x), which returns the number of values less than or equal tox (not including x itself).
    EXAMPLE
    Stream (in order of appearance): 5, getRankOfNumber(l) 0 getRankOfNumber(3) = 1 getRankOfNumber(4) 3
